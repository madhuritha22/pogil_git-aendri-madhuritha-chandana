The battleship code works on the functioal requirement we have mentioned
It has complete working cells, grid well structured, ship placement can be done both horizontally and vertically.
There are two grids which display the distinction between enemy and users.
The graphics shows a hit and miss on the ship and it even shows the ship placement in the users grid.
The hit and miss feature works well.
The gameover screen shows the accuracy, hits and the id we need to play again or exit.
The future things that can make our game more interactive is by adding audio and increasing the level of graphics.
